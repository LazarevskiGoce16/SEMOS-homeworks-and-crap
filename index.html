        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>RK Vardar was founded in 1961, as part of the Vardar Sports Club in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skopje" target="_blank">Skopje</a>, which had been founded in 1947.
            <br/>
            The RK Grafichar Skopje club was established in 1948, which in terms of rank and quality was right behind Rabotnichki. In 1961 Grafichar renamed itself to Vardar and almost the entire team of the club RK Partizan Skopje joined the team. Skopje's club Rabotnichki began to experience a crisis and was no longer the strong first league team from the past, and a more ambitious club Vardar entered the scene. A solid team was created, the mainstays were goalkeeper Jovanovski, as well as Atanasovski, Zdravkovski, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljubomir_Savevski" target="_blank">Savevski</a> and Bozinovski.

            This talent promised a good future and with coach Boskos, who was armed with great knowledge gained in at the time handball superpower Romania, where he lived until moving to Macedonia. Everything was done ambitiously and after all the obstacles were overcome and the fiercest opponents were defeated in 1976, Vardar joined the first division. They played there for 2 seasons, while in the 80s they spent most of the time in the second division.
            <br/>
            The handball team rose to power again in the late 1990s becoming one of the two clubs, alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RK_Eurofarm_Pelister" target="_blank">RK Pelister</a>, to dominate the Macedonian handball scene after the independence of the country.</p>
